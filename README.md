🛡️ WebDefender-X

WebDefender-X is an AI-powered Adaptive Web Application Firewall (AWAF) that detects and mitigates web attacks in real-time. 
It leverages deep learning for anomaly detection and **machine learning models (Autoencoders, Random Forest, MLP) to classify and block threats like **SQL Injection (SQLi), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS).  

🚀 Features
- 🔍 Real-time Traffic Analysis – Captures and monitors HTTP/HTTPS traffic live.  
- 🤖AI-Powered Detection – Uses deep learning & ML models for anomaly detection and classification.  
- ⚡Attack Prevention – Automatically blocks SQLi, XSS, and DDoS attempts.  
- 📊Interactive Dashboard – Visualizes traffic flow, anomalies, and attack metrics in real-time.  
- 🔄Adaptive Learning – Feedback loops continuously improve detection accuracy.  
- 🏗️Modular & Scalable – Easily deployable across different environments with low false positives.
